# Question Topic - Number of paths in a matrix with k coins


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-paths-in-a-matrix-with-k-coins2728/1


## Description

Given a n x n matrix such that each of its cells contains some coins.

Count the number of ways to collect exactly k coins while moving from top left corner of the matrix to the bottom right. From a cell (i, j), you can only move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).

## Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function numberOfPath() which takes n, k and 2D matrix arr[][] as input parameters and returns the number of possible paths.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n*n*k)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*n*k)

## Constraints:

1 <= k < 100

1 <= n < 100

0 <= arrij <= 200
