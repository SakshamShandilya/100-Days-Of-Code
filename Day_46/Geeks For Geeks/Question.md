# Question Topic - Largest Sum Subarray of Size at least K

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-sum-subarray-of-size-at-least-k3121/1

## Description
Given an array a of length n and a number k, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers. 

It is guaranteed that the size of array is at-least k.

## Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSumWithK() which takes the array a[], 

its size n and an integer k as inputs and returns the value of the largest sum of the subarray containing at least k numbers.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

-105 <= a[i] <= 105

1 <= k <= n
