## Description

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. 

You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.


## Constraints:

prerequisites[i].length == 2

0 <= ai, bi < numCourses

All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
