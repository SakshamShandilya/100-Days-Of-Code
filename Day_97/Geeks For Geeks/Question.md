## Description

Given two strings s and t of length n and m respectively. Find the count of distinct occurrences of t in s as a sub-sequence modulo 109 + 7.

## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function subsequenceCount() which takes two strings as argument s and t and returns the count of the sub-sequences modulo 109 + 7.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m).

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m).

## Constraints:

1 ≤ n,m ≤ 1000
