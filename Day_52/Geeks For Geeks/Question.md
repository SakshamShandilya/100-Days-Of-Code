## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-2-sorted-linked-list-in-reverse-order/1

## Description

Given two linked lists of size N and M, which are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The task is to merge them in such a way that the resulting list is in non-increasing order.

## Your Task:
The task is to complete the function mergeResult() which takes reference to the heads of both linked list and returns the pointer to the merged linked list.
