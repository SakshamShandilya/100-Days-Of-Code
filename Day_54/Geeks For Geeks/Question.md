# Question Topic - Longest subarray with sum divisible by K

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-subarray-with-sum-divisible-by-k1259/1


## Description

Given an array arr containing N integers and a positive integer K, 

find the length of the longest sub array with sum of the elements divisible by the given value K.


## Your Task:
The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function longSubarrWthSumDivByK() that takes an array arr, 

sizeOfArray n and a  positive integer K, and returns the length of the longest subarray which has sum divisible by K. 

### Expected Time Complexity: O(N).

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

## Constraints:

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= K <= 109

-109 <= A[i] <= 109
