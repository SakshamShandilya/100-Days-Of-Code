## Description 

Given an array arr of size n, the task is to check if the given array can be a level order representation of a Max Heap.

## Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function isMaxHeap() which takes the array arr[] and its size n as inputs and returns True if the given array could represent a valid level order representation of a Max Heap, or else, it will return False.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

1 ≤ arri ≤ 105
