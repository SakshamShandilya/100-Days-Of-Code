# Question Topic - Subtraction in Linked List


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subtraction-in-linked-list/1


## Description

You are given two linked lists that represent two large positive numbers.

From the two numbers represented by the linked lists, subtract the smaller number from the larger one. Look at the examples to get a better understanding of the task.

## Your Task:
You do not have to take any input or print anything. 

The task is to complete the function subLinkedList() that takes heads of two linked lists as input parameters and which should subtract the smaller number from the larger one represented by the given linked lists and return the head of the linked list representing the result.

n and m are the length of the two linked lists respectively.

### Expected Time Complexity:  O(n+m)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n+m)

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10000

0 <= values represented by the linked lists < 10n

0 <= values represented by the linked lists < 10m
