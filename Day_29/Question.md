## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked


## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100
