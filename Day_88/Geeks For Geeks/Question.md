# Question Topic - Clone an Undirected Graph

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/clone-graph/1

## Description
Given a connected undirected graph with n nodes and m edges, with each node having a distinct label from 0 to n-1, create a clone of the graph. Each node in the graph contains an integer val and an array (neighbors) of nodes, containing nodes that are adjacent to the current node.

Note: If the user returns a correct copy of the given graph, then the system will print 1; in the case when an incorrect copy is generated or when the user returns the original node, the system will print 0.


## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function cloneGraph( ) which takes a node will always be the first node of the graph as input and returns the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n + m).

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

## Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 104

1 <= Node value <= n
