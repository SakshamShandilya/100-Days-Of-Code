# Question topic - Min distance between two given nodes of a Binary Tree

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1

## Description

Given a binary tree with n nodes and two node values, a and b, your task is to find the minimum distance between them. 

The given two nodes are guaranteed to be in the binary tree and all node values are unique.


## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function findDist() which takes the root node of the tree and the two node values a and b as input parameters and returns the minimum distance between the nodes represented by the two given node values.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

## Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105

0 <= Data of a node <= 109
