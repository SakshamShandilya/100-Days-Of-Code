# Question Topic - Geekina Hate 1s


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/geekina-hate-1s/1


## Description

It is a universal fact that Geekina hates 1s however it is also known that Geekina loves the integers having atmost k 1s (set-bits) in their binary representation. 

Geekina demanded nth such non-negative number from Geek, and being a good friend of Geek, now it's your responsibility to tell him that number.

Note: The test cases are generated such that the answer always exists and will fit in the 64-bit data type.


## Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function findNthNumer() that takes n and k as input parameters. Return the nth number having at most k set-bits.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(k*log(n) + constant)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k*log(n) + constant)

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109

1 <= k <= 63
