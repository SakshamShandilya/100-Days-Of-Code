# Question topic - Is it a tree ?

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/is-it-a-tree/1

## Description

You are given an undirected graph of N nodes and M edges. Return 1 if the graph is a tree, else return 0.

Note: The input graph can have self-loops and multiple edges.

## Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function isTree() which takes the integer N (the number nodes in the input graph) and the edges representing the graph as input parameters and returns 1 if the input graph is a tree, else 0.

## Expected Time Complexity: O(N+M)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

## Constraints:

1 <= N <= 2*105

0 <= M <= 2*105
