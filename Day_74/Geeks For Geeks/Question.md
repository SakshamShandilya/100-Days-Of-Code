## Description

Given 3 strings A, B and C, the task is to find the length of the longest sub-sequence that is common in all the three given strings.

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function LCSof3() which takes the strings A, B, C and their lengths n1, n2, n3 as input and returns the length of the longest common subsequence in all the 3 strings.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n1*n2*n3).

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1*n2*n3).

## Constraints:

1 <= n1, n2, n3 <= 20

Elements of the strings consitutes only of the lower case english alphabets.
