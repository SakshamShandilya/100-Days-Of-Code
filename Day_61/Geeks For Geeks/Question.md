# Question Topic - All Unique Permutations of an array

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/all-unique-permutations-of-an-array/1


## Description

Given an array arr[] of length n. Find all possible unique permutations of the array in sorted order. 

A sequence A is greater than sequence B if there is an index i for which Aj = Bj for all j<i and Ai > Bi.

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. You only need to complete the function uniquePerms() that takes an integer n, and an array arr of size n as input and returns a sorted list of lists containing all unique permutations of the array.

### Expected Time Complexity:  O(n*n!)

### Expected Auxilliary Space: O(n*n!)

## Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 9

1 ≤ arri ≤ 10
