## Description

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 105

-30 <= nums[i] <= 30

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
