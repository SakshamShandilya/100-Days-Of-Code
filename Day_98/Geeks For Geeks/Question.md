# Question Topic - Buy and Sell a Share at most twice

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/buy-and-sell-a-share-at-most-twice/1


## Description

In daily share trading, a buyer buys shares in the morning and sells them on the same day. 

If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell). The stock prices throughout the day are represented in the form of an array of prices. 

Given an array price of size n, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

## Your Task:

Complete the function maxProfit() which takes an integer array price as the only argument and returns an integer, representing the maximum profit, if only two transactions are allowed.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

### Expected Space Complexity: O(n)

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105

1 <= price[i] <= 105
