# Question Topic - Sum of leaf nodes in BST


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-leaf-nodes-in-bst/1


## Description

Given a Binary Search Tree with n nodes, find the sum of all leaf nodes. BST has the following property (duplicate nodes are possible):

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node’s key.

Your task is to determine the total sum of the values of the leaf nodes.

Note: Input array arr doesn't represent the actual BST, it represents the order in which the elements will be added into the BST.

## Your Task:

You don't have to take any input or print anything.

You are required to complete the function sumOfLeafNodes that takes root node of a BST with n nodes as parameter and returns the sum of leaf nodes. 

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104

1 <= Value of each node <= 105
