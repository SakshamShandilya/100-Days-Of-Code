# Question Topic - Insert and Search in a Trie


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trie-insert-and-search0651/1


## Description

Complete the Insert and Search functions for a Trie Data Structure. 

Insert: Accepts the Trie's root and a string, modifies the root in-place, and returns nothing.

Search: Takes the Trie's root and a string, returns true if the string is in the Trie, otherwise false.

Note: To test the correctness of your code, the code-judge will be inserting a list of N strings called into the Trie, and then will search for the string key in the Trie. 

The code-judge will generate 1 if the key is present in the Trie, else 0.



## Your Task:

You do not have to take any input or print anything. Complete insert and search functions. 

### Expected Time Complexity: O(M+|key|)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(M)

Here M = sum of the length of all strings which are present in the list[] 

## Constraints:

1 <= N <= 104

1 <= length of list[i] <= 30

All strings will constitute of lowercase alphabets only.
