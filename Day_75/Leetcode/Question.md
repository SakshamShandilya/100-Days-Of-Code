## Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.

Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

## Constraints:

m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

1 <= n, m <= 300

-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109

All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.

All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.

-109 <= target <= 109
