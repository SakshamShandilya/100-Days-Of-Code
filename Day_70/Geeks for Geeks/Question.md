# Question Topic - Fractional Knapsack

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/fractional-knapsack-1587115620/1

## Description

Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item here. 

## Your Task :
Complete the function fractionalKnapsack() that receives maximum capacity , array of structure/class and size N and returns a double value representing the maximum value in knapsack.

Note: The details of structure/class is defined in the comments above the given function.

### Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)

### Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

## Constraints:

1 <= N <= 105

1 <= W <= 109

1 <= valuei, weighti <= 104
