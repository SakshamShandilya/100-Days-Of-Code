## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked

## Description
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


## Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105

-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

nums is a non-decreasing array.

-109 <= target <= 109
