# Question Topic - Anti Diagonal Traversal of Matrix

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-diagonally1623/1

## Description

Give a N*N square matrix, return an array of its anti-diagonals in top-leftmost to bottom-rightmost order. 

In an element of a anti-diagonal (i, j), surrounding elements will be (i+1, j-1) and (i-1, j+1). 

Look at the examples for more clarity.

## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function antiDiagonalPattern() that takes matrix as input parameter and returns a list of integers in order of the values visited in the anti-Diagonal pattern. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * N)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N * N)

## Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100

0 <= mat[i][j] <= 100
