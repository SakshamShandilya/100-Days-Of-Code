# Question Topic - Find duplicate rows in a binary matrix

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-duplicate-rows-in-a-binary-matrix/1


## Description

Given a boolean matrix of size RxC where each cell contains either 0 or 1, 

find the row numbers (0-based) of row which already exists or are repeated.

## Your Task:
You dont need to read input or print anything. 

Complete the function repeatedRows() that takes the matrix as input parameter and returns a list of row numbers which are duplicate rows.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(R * C)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(R * C)

## Constraints:

1 ≤ R, C ≤ 103

0 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1
