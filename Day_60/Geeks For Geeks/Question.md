## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sequence-of-sequence1155/1


## Description

Given two integers m and n, try making a special sequence of numbers seq of length n such that

seqi+1 >= 2*seqi 

seqi > 0

seqi <= m

Your task is to determine total number of such special sequences possible.

## Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function numberSequence() which takes the number m and n as input parameters and returns the number of possible special sequences.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(m*n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Constraints:

1 â‰¤ m, n â‰¤ 100
