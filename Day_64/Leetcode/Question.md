# Question Topic - Reverse Nodes in k-Group


## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked


## Description

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. 

If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.


## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.

1 <= k <= n <= 5000

0 <= Node.val <= 1000
