# Question Topic - Reverse First K elements of Queue


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-first-k-elements-of-queue/1


## Description

Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue

dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue

size() : Returns number of elements in queue.

front() : Finds front item.

Note: The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.

## Your Task:

Complete the provided function modifyQueue() that takes queue and K as parameters and returns a modified queue. 

The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

### Expected Time Complexity : O(N)

### Expected Auxiliary Space : O(K)

## Constraints:

1 <= K <= N <= 105
