## Description

Given a string, s, the objective is to convert it into integer format without utilizing any built-in functions. 

If the conversion is not feasible, the function should return -1.

Note: Conversion is feasible only if all characters in the string are numeric or if its first character is '-' and rest are numeric.

## Your Task:

You do not have to take any input or print anything. 

Complete the function atoi() which takes a string s as an input parameter and returns an integer value representing the given string.

If the conversion is not feasible, the function should return -1.

|s| = length of string str.

### Expected Time Complexity: O( |s| ), 

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10
