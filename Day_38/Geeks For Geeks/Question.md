## Description
Given a square matrix of size n*n. The task is to find the determinant of this matrix.


## Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function determinantOfMatrix() that takes matrix and its size n as input parameters and returns the determinant of the matrix.

#### Expected Time Complexity: O(N4)
#### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

## Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10
-10 <= mat[i][j] <= 10
