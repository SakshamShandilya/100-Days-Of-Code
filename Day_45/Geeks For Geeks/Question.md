## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-pair-sum-divisibility-problem3257/1


## Description
Given an array of integers nums and a number k, 

write a function that returns true if given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

## Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function canPair() which takes array nums and k as input parameter and returns true if array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k otherwise returns false.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

### Expected Space Complexity : O(n)

## Constraints:

1 <= length( nums ) <= 105

1 <= numsi <= 105

1 <= k <= 105
