## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked


## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 

The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].

0 <= Node.val <= 9

It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
