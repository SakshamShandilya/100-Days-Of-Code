# Question Topic - Maximum Sum Problem


## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sum-problem2211/1


## Description

A number n can be broken into three parts n/2, n/3, and n/4 (consider only the integer part).

Each number obtained in this process can be divided further recursively.

Find the maximum sum that can be obtained by summing up the divided parts together.

Note: It is possible that we don't divide the number at all.

## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxSum() which accepts an integer n and returns the maximum sum.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

## Constraints:

0 <= n <= 106
