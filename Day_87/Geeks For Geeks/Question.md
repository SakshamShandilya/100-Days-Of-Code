# Question Topic - Recursive sequence

## Link - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/recursive-sequence1611/1

## Description

A function F is defined as follows F(n)= (1) +(2*3) + (4*5*6) ... upto n terms (look at the examples for better clarity). Given an integer n, determine the F(n).

Note: As the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 109+7.

## Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. 

Your task is to complete the function sequence() which takes an integer n as an input parameter and returns the value of F(n).

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)

### Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

## Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 103
