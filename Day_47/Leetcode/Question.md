## Description
You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

0 representing an empty cell,

1 representing a fresh orange, or

2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

## Constraints:

m == grid.length

n == grid[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 10

grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
