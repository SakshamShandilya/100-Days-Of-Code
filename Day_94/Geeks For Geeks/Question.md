## Description

Given a string s of lowercase alphabets and a number k, the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of k characters. 

The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character present in the string. 

## Your Task:

You do not need to read input or print anything.

Your task is to complete the function minValue() which takes s and k as input parameters and returns the minimum possible required value.


### Expected Time Complexity: O(n+klog(p))  

where n is the length of string and p is number of distinct alphabets and k number of alphabets to be removed. 

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

## Constraints:

0 ≤ k ≤ |string length| ≤ 105
