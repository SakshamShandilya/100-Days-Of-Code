# Question Topic - Validate Binary Search Tree

## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].

-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
