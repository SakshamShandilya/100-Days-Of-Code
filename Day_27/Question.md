# Question Topic - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-100-liked


## Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 

“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T 

that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

## Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].

-109 <= Node.val <= 109

All Node.val are unique.

p != q

p and q will exist in the tree.
